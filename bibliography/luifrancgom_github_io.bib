	abstract = {There are a large number of different definitions used for sample quantiles in statistical computer packages. Often within the same package one definition will be used to compute a quantile explicitly, while other definitions may be used when producing a boxplot, a probability plot, or a QQ plot. We compare the most commonly implemented sample quantile definitions by writing them in a common notation and investigating their motivation and some of their properties. We argue that there is a need to adopt a standard definition for sample quantiles so that the same answers are produced by different packages and within each package. We conclude by recommending that the median-unbiased estimator be used because it has most of the desirable properties of a quantile estimator and can be defined independently of the underlying distribution.},

	abstract = {In 1821, the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy published Cours d'Analyse de L'École Royale Polytechnique, a textbook designed to teach his students the basic theorems of calculus in as rigorous a way as possible. Cauchy was a pioneer of mathematical analysis, a branch of mathematics concerned with the idea of a limit, whether of a sequence or of a function. This book consists of 12 chapters that discuss real functions, infinitely small and large quantities, substitution groups, symmetrical functions, unknown variables, imaginary functions, and rational fractions in a recurrent series. It also provides formulas for solving various problems, such as converting the sine and cosine of a multiple polynomial arc and the Lagrange interpolation. Cauchy built on the work of Leibniz and Newton and is generally regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians in history. This is a reissue of one of his most important contributions},
